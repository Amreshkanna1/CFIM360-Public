# CFIM360° — The Architecture of Inner Intelligence

CFIM360° is a unified system architecture for Human Emotion, Cognition, and Somatics.  
It integrates **Emotional Cybernetics (EC)**, **Cognitive Cybernetics (CC)**, and  
**Somatic Cybernetics (SC)** into one measurable, reproducible operating model of inner intelligence.

This repository contains the official source code for **cfim360.com**, including:
- The full documentation site
- Static HTML, CSS, and assets
- Canonical sitemap and robots configuration
- Custom domain (CNAME) configuration for GitHub Pages

## Core Concept

CFIM360° provides a structured model that explains:
- How inner signals are *created*  
- How they *shape impact*  
- How they *reorganize into a stable model of intelligence*

This triad — **Creation → Impact → Model** — forms the foundation  
for unified cybernetics across emotional, cognitive, and somatic systems.
